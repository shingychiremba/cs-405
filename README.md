Journal: Portfolio Reflection

In the past, security was always adopted at the end, almost as a last measure. This proved to be undesirable over time because security was being added to applications with insecure protocols, callbacks and authentication methods. Incorporating security from the start of the development process ensures that a secure product is being created. Not only does the product account for vulnerabilities as it is built but security measures can be added at the time their detected to ensure that the whole product has no weaknesses. Adding security at the end is like trying to add a biometric lock to a paper safe. If the safe is not secure all around it the lock does not protect the safe’s contents because the safe can be accessed from virtually any side because it is made of paper, it is a weak safe that is not secure. This goes the same for the code, putting encryption and authentication at the end to a code that has open ended calls which openly invite SQL Injection will not protect the code from SQL Injection threats.

Threats are prevented during development, during deployment and during implementation. Preventing threats at every stage of the SDLC and beyond is crucial in the tech world because hackers are waiting to exploit known vulnerabilities most of which are derived from insecure coding practices. Using secure coding practices during software development is the first line of defense. Secure coding standards like CERT C, CWE and OSWAP are highly recommended when developing code because they help protect from mistakes that are common and known by the bad actors. After the code is in use, regular maintenance and necessary updates  keep the code in check because no program is safe with hackers always on the prowl.
According to Microsoft, “Zero Trust is a high-level strategy that assumes that individuals, devices, and services that are attempting to access company resources, even those inside the network, cannot automatically be trusted. To enhance security these users are verified every time they request access, even if they were authenticated earlier” (Microsoft, 2021).
